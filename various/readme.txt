Downloader Bash script for https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/

I found it necessary for OSINT / HUMINT but also as self defence against cybermobbing to have a resource of these, so I'd be able to cross-reference with accounts. 
Don't get me wrong, each image is a new, random one. But the do have some resembleance and you may be able to recognize a "similar" image from your pool of downloaded images

Use at your own risk, I'm not responsible, if TOS of https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ does disallow usage of script downloads. I only wrote the code, you're the one, who is 
using it. Be respectful to such useful services like https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ and don't let the script run too fast or for hours long, please, generating a ton of traffic.

Thanks.
