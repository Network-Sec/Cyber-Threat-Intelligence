Downloader Bash script for https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/

I found it necessary for OSINT / HUMINT but also as self defence against cybermobbing to have a resource of these, so I'd be able to cross-reference with accounts. 
Don't get me wrong, each image is a new, random one. But they do have some resemblance and you may be able to recognize a "similar" image from your pool of downloaded images.

Script adds date and time, check date of account creation for the social media account in question. 

- Use at your own risk, I'm not responsible, if TOS of https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ does disallow usage of script downloads. I only wrote the code, you're the one, who's potenially using it. 
- Be respectful to such useful services like https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ - please don't let the script run too fast or for hours long, generating a ton of traffic. 
- It may be even more useful to have it run long-term but at a very low rate like once per 5 minutes or so. 

Thanks for consideration.
